        <p>This is a website I'm making to document my forever world as I create it! I'll be saving extended versions of my journal entries here, as well as my favorite builds, texture packs, and videos I've made!</p>
        <p>This site is both a major and constant work in progress, but I hope to capture the excited energy that I've been feeling recently. I hope you enjoy viewing this website as much as I'm enjoying making it &lt;3</p>
