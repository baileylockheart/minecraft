<p>I started terraforming today!! I covered up some of the holes I kept falling in, ofc I made sure they didn't have any good ores in them first. I also upped my tick speed, which is cool.</p>
<p>I also tried out creative mode!! It's useful for the mentioned terraforming, but I like survival better... Mostly. I LOVE getting to have lots of materials, and the flying is awesome! I got myself an elyctra :3 I also made a tower to celebrate finding diamond, and I made altars to my deities in it!</p>
