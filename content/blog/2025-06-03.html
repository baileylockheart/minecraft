<p>June 3, 2025</p>
<p>I had something REALLY scary happen today. Okay, for context, I recently set up pens for my sheep and cows, and I had previously had incidents of wolves eating my sheep, so I was very careful about making my fences tall enough.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I went on a little adventure adventure and made my first big pixel art thing! which was fun, but when I came back, they were all gone?? Not just the cows and sheep though, but also my chickens and all of my dogs! I legit got really nervous, but I noticed that everything was laggy,so I left the world and came back, and luckily, they all came back!! Apparently, it was a glitch or something??</p>
<p>Also, for a completely different brand of scary, I explored the nether a LOT today, mostly looting bastions! I did that a lot, also found a fortress and ran through there, and even tried the bed-explosions thingy! After all that, I ended up with a ton of ancient debris, a few smithing templates, and even some already-smelted netherite scraps!! I decided to go through with everything and make myself some netherite tools!! I don't feel like I'm far enough in to "deserve" them, but I'm really happy to have them :3</p>
