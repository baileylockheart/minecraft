<p>I went into the deep dark biome and broke a bunch of stuff to level up, and I finally tried enchanting!! I did cheat a bit and spawn in a book because I wanted a silk touch pickaxe, but I also crafted an enchanting table to do my other gear with! I also tried to ACTUALLY play in survival this time around; aside from the book, no spawning in supplies!! I'm definitely learning that I should turn off learn recipes if I ever wanna do a survival-only playthrough, since my brain doesn't have the space for all the recipes yet.</p>
<p>I also made a sheep pen! I dyed a few of them, and don't really intend to breed them any more than I already have, but setting up something like this makes me feel like one of the letsplayers I like. So basically it makes me feel like I know what I'm doing?? But admittedly, setting the pen up included setting up a wheat farm as well, so I'm gaming for real today :'D</p>
