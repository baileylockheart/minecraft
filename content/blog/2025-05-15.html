<p>My forever world!! I'm super excited to finally have one! Technically I started yesterday, but still. This is my first time REALLY playing minecraft, and I've never actually had an in-game journal like this before!! I'm having a lot of fun so far, and I'm really happy with it!</p>
<p>I went fishing, and I got enough bones to find some wolf friends!! AND THEY HAD A BABY!!! I also mined as far down as I could, and found gold! Lapis too!! I also made a treehouse today! I love my forever world :3</p>
