<p>I found a cave area with a bunch of amethyst in it!! It was super pretty and purple :3 I took some stuff but left it mostly intact since it was so pretty.</p>
<p>Also, I think I found something cooler than that?? In a big cave area behind my house, there's a deep dark biome at the bottom, and there was a TON of cool stuff! I found discs and an armor trim and enchanted stuff and TONS of potions, which is super cool!! I might have to make a separate storage space though, since my "special stuff from adventures" chest is getting pretty full :'D</p>
