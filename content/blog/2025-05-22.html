<p>I found a lush cave today!! Or at least, I think I did? It was inside a much bigger dripstone cave, so I'm not sure, but either way, it was REALLY pretty!! I found lots of glow berries, which was cool, I might have to find somewhere to put them on my house!</p>
<p>I also found this weird area that looked like literal mines?? There were minecarts and lit pathways and MOB SPAWNERS?? Thankfully I'm in peaceful mode so nothing happened, I just got to watch a zombie spin around in a fire cage. There were also lots of chests, and I found two discs!! They were my first two so far, but I wanna collect more of them ^^</p>
