<p>It's been a bit, hi, but GUESS WHO DEFEATED THE ENDER DRAGON???!? I did it decently legit too, I got the pearls from piglin bartering and I got the rods from killing blazes, no creative required!</p>
<p>In terms of the actual fight, I kept dying, so I'm SUPER glad I got a waypoint addon and saved the end portal as a waypoint :'D  Also of all things, SCAFFOLDING made the fight possible for me?? but it was pretty fun! I set up a little monument with the egg in my world, and made sure to date it, since this is a pretty big thing for me!</p>
<p>When I first started my forever world, I had NO intention of defeating the ender dragon, but a month in, and I've already done it! This was my first time ever defeating the ender dragon, so it feels super special to me :3</p>
