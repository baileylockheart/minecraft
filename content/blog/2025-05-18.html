<p>I've been flying around a lot and doing things! I made a nice cherry house, and I did a bunch of mining in a cave I'd NEVER be able to access from the ground level. I also made my everything forest!!! That way I can get different wood colors whenever I want them!
<p>I also got my first horse and I made a stable for him!! I also FINALLY named my dogs :3 My first two are Penelope and Odysseus, and their baby is Telemachus because Epic and I said so.</p>
<p>I rebuilt the inside of my house, and I also made an outdoor space for my dogs to hang out in!! I'm really happy with my forever world so far :3</p>
