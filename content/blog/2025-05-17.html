<p>I finished up my castle tower for the most part, and I've been using creative mode to fly around!! I still switch back to survival so I can collect stuff, though. Apparently, I live decently close to a pale oak forest!!</p>
<p>Also, I figured out teleporting, FINALLY. I'm making random houses and treehouses everywhere so that I'll always have somewhere to stay while I'm exploring :3 also, I MADE A NETHER PORTAL!!! I like it, but I've never been more grateful for keep inventory tho :'D</p>
