<p>I made a basement for my base!! Specifically, I made a semi-hidden basement! I used redstone stuff and a sticky piston to move the crafting table that blocks the passage! I also put a little waterfall and even some paintings! I'm honestly pretty proud of it :3 as of now, I'm using it as an ideas room!</p>
<p>I had to figure out minecraft's color codes in order to put the signs up correctly, since I had a few mangrove signs which do NOT like black text, but it just lists out a bunch of my ideas of what I plan to do moving forward!</p>
