<p>A modpack intended to make farming into a more fun experience! It isn't particularly excessive in terms of changes, just aiming to make a vanilla-adjacent experience, but with more options and fewer inconveniences.</p>
<p>You can create your own world if you'd like, and build a farm in exactly the way you'd like, but this modpack comes with a world of its own! Most of it's unexplored, but it gives you a base and a farm to begin with. If you're looking to break and regrow wheat for the pure satisfaction of it, I highly suggest it ^^ Overall, this modpack aims to make farming a nicer experience overall, so I hope you enjoy it :3</p>
