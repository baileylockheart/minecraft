<p>This is a small texture pack with glowing ores, intended for use with the pack <a href="https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/kdcraft" target="_blank">KDCraft</a>! I highly recommend the original texture pack! I just made this to play around with making emissive textures, and to add to my own world using that pack :&rpar;</p>
