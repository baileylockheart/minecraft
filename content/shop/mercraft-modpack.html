<p>A somewhat simple modpack for someone who wants ocean adventures but nothing too crazy :3 This modpack intends to create a fun mermaid experience, without being too jarring if you're used to vanilla!</p>
<p>When you start your playthrough, pick the "merling" origin, and find water as quickly as you can! If you'd like to customize your tail, you can use a sea necklace! You should be given one right away, but if now, you can attain them with both crafting and creative! To add some personality to your tail, you can customize it with gradients, dyes, and more!  <a href="https://github.com/ThatPreston/Mermod-Fabric/wiki/Overview" target="_blank">Mermod's wiki</a> is helpful if you want a better idea of how to do this. You can place this in the necklace slot, which you can find from hovering over where you'd put a chestplate. From there, find an ocean and start exploring!</p>
