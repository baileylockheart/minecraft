<p>A somewhat simple modpack for someone who wants ocean adventures but nothing too crazy :3 This modpack intends to create a fun mermaid experience, without being too jarring if you're used to vanilla!</p>
<p>When you start your playthrough, pick the "merling" origin, and find water as quickly as you can! If you'd like to customize your tail, you can use a sea necklace! You can attain them with crafting and creative, I'd suggest creative, and you can customize them with gradients, dyes, and more! <a href="https://github.com/ThatPreston/Mermod-Fabric/wiki/Overview" target="_blank">Mermod's wiki</a> is helpful if you want a better idea of how to do this. You can place this in the necklace slot, which you can find from hovering over where you'd put a chestplate. From there, find an ocean and start exploring!</p>
