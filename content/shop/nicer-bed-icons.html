<p>Hihi!! I wanted to make some pastel-y bed icons that weren't quite as,, round :'D I don't really like the vanilla icons too much, and I use <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/better-beds-bedrock/" target="_blank">Better Beds</a> by <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/v3nuszce/" target="_blank">v3nuszce</a> in my forever world, so I wanted to make icons to use along with it! I based the colors off of their texture pack, the general shading off of the vanilla beds, and the general shape off of again, not wanting them to be round ^^; I hope you like them :3</p>
